#### I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying computer science.  Here are links to some of my notable projects:

1695 BBB Computer Lab
My teammate and I recreated a popular computer lab in the University of Michigan's Bob and Betty Beyster Building in a virtual reality environment.  This project was created using Unreal Engine 5.2, Unreal blueprints, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com for sound effects, and sketchfab for 3d models.  Here is the resulting project <a href="https://youtu.be/VbM1yUCU9iA">demo</a>.

A2-Go!
Together with another person, I made an augmented reality app that is a clone of the popular Pokemon Go app.  This app (known as A2-Go) is focused around planting trees to generate cash, fending off squirrels, and exploring several landmarks in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This project was created using Unity Engine 2021, C# scripting, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com and my-instants for sound effects, and sketchfab for 3d models.  Here is a demo of the project <a href="https://youtu.be/zUrP7mEJmAM">demo</a>.

Meta-Museum
With a team of five, we created Meta-Museum, a virtual replica of portions of th famous Metropolitan in New York City.  Our mission with this project was to allow people that do not have the means of traveling to museums the ability to experience the museum virtually and learn about its art.  We used Unreal Engine 5.2, Unreal blueprints, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com for sound effects, Quixel for materials, and sketchfab for 3d models.
