#### I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying computer science.  Here are links to some of my notable projects:

1695 BBB Computer Lab
My teammate and I recreated a popular computer lab in the University of Michigan's Bob and Betty Beyster Building in a virtual reality environment.  This project was created using Unreal Engine 5.2, Unreal blueprints, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com for sound effects, and sketchfab for 3d models.  Here is the resulting project <a href="https://youtu.be/VbM1yUCU9iA">demo</a>.
