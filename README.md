#### I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying computer science.  Here are links to some of my notable projects:

1695 BBB Computer Lab
My teammate and I recreated a popular computer lab in the University of Michigan's Bob and Betty Beyster Building in a virtual reality environment.  This project was created using Unreal Engine 5.2, Unreal blueprints, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com for sound effects, and sketchfab for 3d models.  Here is the resulting project <a href="https://youtu.be/VbM1yUCU9iA">demo</a>.

A2-Go!
Together with another person, I made an augmented reality app that is a clone of the popular Pokemon Go app.  This app (known as A2-Go) is focused around planting trees to generate cash, fending off squirrels, and exploring several landmarks in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This project was created using Unity Engine 2021, C# scripting, Jira for sprint planning/task delegation, freesound.com and my-instants for sound effects, and sketchfab for 3d models.  Here is a demo of the project <a href="https://youtu.be/kvBXJmPGlPg">demo</a>.
